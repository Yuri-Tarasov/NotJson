# NotJson
**NotJson** is a Tree like data structure with binary serialization to socket or file! 

### Why use NotJson?
In Json, each node can be a real value - String, Number, Bool and another object or Array.

In NotJson: 
- Each node contains Only real values.
- Multidimensional associative array.
- Transmitted data  on the network in Binary form.
- Do not waste resources on parsing.
- Store binary data in tree node.

Base element of NotJson - **njsNode** object.

njsNode:
 - value (String, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64, Bool,  Binary, Null)
 - childs (list ref objects njsNode)


### Init for JS
```javascript
var root = new njsNode("Cars");

// Magic! No throw 'TypeError: Cannot set property of undefined'
root["Models"]["Ford"]["Fiesta"] = "Comment for Fiesta";  
root["Models"]["Ford"]["Focus"] = "Comment for Focus";
root["Models"]["Ford"]["Mustang"] = "Comment for Mustang";

root["Models"]["BMW"]["320"] = "Comment for 320"; 
root["Models"]["BMW"]["X3"] = "Comment for X3";
root["Models"]["BMW"]["X5"] = "Comment for X5";

root["Models"]["Fiat"]["500"] = "Comment for 500"; 
root["Models"]["Fiat"]["Panda"] = "Comment for Panda";

root["Models"] = "Comment for group Models";
root["Models"]["BMW"] = "Comment for group Models/BMW";

// use reserved key - "item" for append to end
root["item"] = "value for item first"; // will be rename to -> item_0
root["item"] = "value for item second";  // will be rename to -> item_1

console.log(root.toString(0, false)); // do not show [type] 
```
### Result
```text
Cars: 
  Models: 'Comment for group Models'
    Ford: 
      Fiesta: 'Comment for Fiesta'
      Focus: 'Comment for Focus'
      Mustang: 'Comment for Mustang'
    BMW: 'Comment for group Models/BMW'
      320: 'Comment for 320'
      X3: 'Comment for X3'
      X5: 'Comment for X5'
    Fiat: 
      500: 'Comment for 500'
      Panda: 'Comment for Panda'
  item_0: 'value for item first'
  item_1: 'value for item second
```
